## Introduction

This portal is an extremely efficient, highly scalable, all-in-one, easy to setup cryptocurrency mining pool written entirely in Node.JS. Its main features include a stratum poolserver and reward/payment/share processor. The website functionality has been removed as the Blinkhash Mining Pool uses a custom-built front-end design. If you want to access the Blinkhash Mining Pool, however, the website is available at https://blinkhash.com.

Documentation for the API is currently available at https://github.com/blinkhash/blinkhash-documentation. The API itself was specifically designed to be self-explanatory while still providing users with standardized JSON-formatted responses.

### Need Support?

If you need help with an API or code-related matter, the first place to look is our [Discord](https://www.discord.gg/x2vgyZP), where I'll be available to answer any questions. However, please do not come to me with issues regarding how to clone/setup the server. Use Google for that.

## Specifications

### Features

* For the pool server it uses the [blinkhash-stratum-pool](https://github.com/blinkhash/blinkhash-stratum-pool) module which supports vardiff, POW & POS, transaction messages, anti-DDoS, IP banning, [several hashing algorithms](https://github.com/blinkhash/blinkhash-stratum-pool#hashing-algorithms-supported).
* Multipool ability - this software was built from the ground up to run with multiple coins simultaneously (which can have different properties and hashing algorithms). It can be used to create a pool for a single coin or for multiple coins at once. The pools use clustering to load balance across multiple CPU cores.
* For reward/payment processing, shares are inserted into Redis (a fast NoSQL key/value store). The PPLNT reward system is used with [Redis Transactions](http://redis.io/topics/transactions) for secure and super speedy payouts. There is zero risk to the pool operator. Shares from rounds resulting in orphaned blocks will be merged into share in the current round so that each and every share will be rewarded
* This portal does not have user accounts/logins/registrations. Instead, miners simply use their coin address for stratum authentication.

### Attack Mitigation

* Detects and thwarts socket flooding (garbage data sent over socket in order to consume system resources).
* Detects and thwarts zombie miners (botnet infected computers connecting to your server to use up sockets but not sending any shares).
* Detects and thwarts invalid share attacks:
   * This server is not vulnerable to the low difficulty share exploits happening to other pool servers. Rather than using hardcoded max difficulties for new hashing algorithms, it dynamically generates the max difficulty for each algorithm based on values found in the coin source code.
   * IP banning feature which on a configurable threshold will ban an IP for a configurable amount of time if the miner submits over a configurable threshold of invalid shares.
* The server is written in Node.js which uses a single thread (async) to handle connections rather than the overhead of one thread per connection. Clustering is also implemented so that all CPU cores are taken advantage of.

### Security

* Without a registration/login system, non-security-oriented miners reusing passwords across pools is no longer a concern.
* Automated payouts by default and pool profits are sent to another address so pool wallets aren't plump with coins, giving hackers few rewards and keeping your pool from being a target.
* Miners can notice lack of automated payments as a possible early warning sign that an operator is about to run off with their coins.

### Transparency

* The API was specifically designed to be as transparent as possible regarding payouts and shares. Everything is logged for users to check and ensure that everything is legitimate.
* The server itself will always be open-source. Feel free to create relevant issues and pull requests whenever necessary.

## Setup

### Requirements

* Coin daemon(s) (Find the coin's repository and build the latest version from source)
* [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) v12.0+ (Tested with v12.16.1) ([Instructions](https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installing-Node.js-via-package-manager))
* [Redis](http://redis.io/) key-value store v2.6+ (Tested with v5.0.7) ([Instructions](http://redis.io/topics/quickstart))

Note: Those are legitimate requirements. If you use old versions of Node.js or Redis that may come with your system package manager then you will have problems. Follow the linked instructions to get the last stable versions.

Beyond this, make sure to give Redis firewall access - an easy way is to include `bind 127.0.0.1` in your `redis.conf` file. Also, it's a good idea to learn about and understand all aspects of the software that you are using. A good place to start with Redis is [data persistence](http://redis.io/topics/persistence).

#### 1) Setting up Coin Daemon

Follow the build/install instructions for your coin daemon. Your coin.conf file should end up looking something like this:

```
daemon=1
rpcuser=blinkhash
rpcpassword=blinkhash
rpcport=26710
```

For redundancy, it's recommended to have at least two daemon instances running in case one drops out-of-sync or offline. All instances listed will be polled for block/transaction updates and be used for submitting blocks. Creating a backup daemon involves spawning a daemon using the `-datadir=/backup` command-line argument which creates a new daemon instance with it's own config directory and coin.conf file. Learn about the daemon, how to use it and how it works if you want to be a good pool operator. For starters, be sure to read:
   * https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Running_bitcoind
   * https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Data_directory
   * https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Original_Bitcoin_client/API_Calls_list
   * https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Difficulty

#### 2) Downloading & Installing

Clone the repository and run `npm update` for all the dependencies to be installed:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/blinkhash/blinkhash-server blinkhash-server
cd blinkhash-server
npm update
```

#### 3) Configuration

Rename the `example.json` file to `config.json`. Inside it, ensure that the default configuration will work for your environment before starting the pool.

You can create as many of these pool files as you want. If you are creating multiple pools, ensure that they have unique stratum ports. For more information on these configuration options, see the [pool module documentation](https://github.com/blinkhash/blinkhash-stratum-pool#module-usage).

#### 4) Starting the Pool

In order to start the pool, simply run the following line of code.

```
npm run start
```
